# Lambda

This is a project I began building a little while back
The issue with most workout apps (for me) is that I don't have access to the level of detail I'd like to be able to actually answer important training questions.
For context, I have a statistics background and work as a business analyst, where I analyze the data of a medium sized company (we're about 160 employees).

Lambda is only one piece of the big plan that I'm working on, the other plans are coaching, YouTube and a unique way of approaching calisthenics training (or maybe training in general)

This is just a passion project so I'm just working on it alone (but I'm never alone, I always have AI :D)
